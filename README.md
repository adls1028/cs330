# Final Project README

How do I approach designing software?
Some of the things I kept in mind throughout this project were usability, readability, and future use. I did my best keeping in mind my ability to be able to look back at my code and figure out what each section of code did. That is why I used many comments throughout my code and split it into a .cpp for the scene and one for the shapes. Additionally, I wanted to be able to have code that could transfer over to another use. 

How do I approach developing programs?
Throughout this process, I used iteration in my development process. I wanted to start with a test amount of code, to which I went through multiple versions. I was able to make sure everything worked in small bits before adding additional shapes or features. This ensured that I was keeping all project goals in mind while adding to my code. While working through this class, I kept figuring out better ways to improve my code and make my comments clear and concise. I believe this helped me stay organized and make sure all portions of the project were accounted for. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
